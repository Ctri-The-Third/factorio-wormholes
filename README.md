# factorio-wormholes

I am a big fan of roguelikes. 
I also really like Factorio Space Age's platforms and the idea of space bases.
I also really like the experience of setting up new resource outposts and the like.
I also happen to think the "congrats you won!" screen is a little lackluster for an ending.


## New Game + 

The dream is that a player can take themselves and a fleet of ships through a wormhole and leave all their spaghetti behind to create a new factory with all the hard earned progress of before.

With all technologies maintained, equipment equipped, and any items you brought on your space platform available, hurl yourself down onto unsuspecting planets with low evolution values and enjoy steamrolling the early game experience without the technical debt your previous factories had accumulated.


## Learning

This is my first time modding Factorio or working with LUA, please be understanding.
You are welcome to explore my code to improve your own understanding.

## installation and publishing

not yet published because it doesn't yet work. Will put it on the factorio mod portal when it's done :)

## statement on AI

Generative AI was not used to create any code, graphics, or other assets.
However, Claude Code was helpful in assisting with troubleshooting for the first couple of days until I found my feet with LUA.
