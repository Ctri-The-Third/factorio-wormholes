X we get the wormhole setup in place
X we get "on arrival" detection in place
X    we got "player arrival" detection in place
X we get a popup 
X    with a yes/no dialog
X we figure out how to make new surfaces
  X including Nauvis
  X alter the seed
X we figure out how to delete surfaces 
X we figure out how to delete platforms
X Get a wormhole icon
    Get a better wormhole icon

Rejig the technology to require the Prometheum science pack?
Pause game whilst dialog is open?  (prevents platforms wandering away and becoming invalid targets for the wormhole script)
Autosave before performing delete?  (allows rollback)
Preserve characters on Nauvis  (prevents disembodied players)
    how? teleport them? Kill em so they respawn on new Nauvis?
